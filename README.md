# mailer
Python script to automate mailing thousands of mail with just few lines of code.

We have used the python libraries openpyxl and pandas. So please install these libraries in case you are facing any issues.

All the emails are placed in the .xlsx file and then these email values are fetched in a list. Please provide full path of the excel sheet.

The whole path of the file has to be provided which contains the body of the mail.
